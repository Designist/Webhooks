# Webhooks
This repository was intended to be a test for uploading Typeform responses to Github via Zapier. However, as far as I can tell, Github does not allow file uploading or creation via an external site. Services like Zapier, IFTTT, and Bipio can only create new issues and (empty) pull requests via Github.

Therefore this repository serves as documentation for use of Zapier and Typeform. Currently, Typeform data is uploaded via Zapier to a Dropbox repository, where it is stored in [this folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/scx0ibzzgjgvcvh/AAAm1jIaPgWx5Bl6TwwfW9Q6a?dl=0) as a .txt file in JSON form. Unfortunately, we can't test file uploading until we purchase a PRO version of Typeform or use a different form website.
